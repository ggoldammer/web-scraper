# web-scraper(PseudoCode)

I'll need to create a scraper that uses Cheerio to scan through the NYT website's id's and class names to extract and parse the correct information.

This information will then have the ability to be saved to a database of saved articles that can be removed.

Technologies that will be used are Cheerio, Node, Mongo, Mongoose, CSS (Bootstrap).
